###### What is Markdown?
is a language of markup 

## Headings
# Main title
## Title level: 2 (Section)
### Title level: 3 (Subsection)
#### Title level: 4 (Subsubsection) 
##### Title level: 5
###### Title level: 6

## Paragraph
The text does not go to the next line 
even when it is written in that way.  
Two whitespace are needed for a new line while two newline inputs

for a new paragraph.

## Emphasis
There exists two ways for **bolding** __text__:  
use two * or two _ before and after the word.

Only one * is needed for get the text *italic* and a combination for both the options.

## Blackquotes
Anteposing a > makes a block quotes as in the following example:
> Main the gap between the train and the platform.

## Insert an image
The command line for inserting an image is the following
`![Immagine](images/isteresi.png "Esempio di immagine")`
(the text cointained in the backticks - Alt + 96 - is interpreted as code).  

Anyway, since Markdown has not a command for resizing the image, it is possible to insert HTML code for doing this:
'<img src="immagine.png" alt="Descrizione" width="300"/>'
<img src="images/isteresi.png" alt="Descrizione" width="300"/>  

## Insert a document
